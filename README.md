Machine Learning for anyone who is not a Data Scientist, Computer Science Researcher or Mathematician.


# General:

Started Spetember 7th, 2020

This will mainly use Javascript https://www.tensorflow.org/js to make Deep Learning models and to view them, then tfjs_convert and tflite_convert to convert the models to c header files and then TensorflowMicro a subset of tensorflowLite https://www.tensorflow.org/lite to run the models on Arduino style microcontrollers.


Information here will be condenscend and simplified from these sites I have made:

1. https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/  but I work mainly from the github website version at https://hpssjellis.github.io/beginner-tensorflowjs-examples-in-javascript/

2. The gitpod version of https://github.com/hpssjellis/Gitpod-auto-tensorflowJS-to-arduino   by using this link https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/Gitpod-auto-tensorflowJS-to-arduino

3. This Machine Learning site using the PortentaH7 which should work for many other Arduino boards (SeeeduinoXIAO, Nano 33BLESense PortentaH7 and hopefully the ESP32 eventually)  https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-for-the-arduino-portentaH7/tree/master/m09-Tensoflow



# Lets Get Started:

1. My easiest Deep Learning example is at https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/beginner-keras/20keras-xOr.html Try to understand as much as you can about this one page program as all other programs will be in some ways easier. It uses 2 inputs that are either on or off and ouputs one decimal number about how close it things the answer is to either 1 or 0. Make sure you change variables and try to imporve the example.
