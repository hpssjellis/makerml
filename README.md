Machine Learning for anyone who is not a Data Scientist, Computer Science Researcher or Mathematician.

Started Spetember 7th, 2020


Information here will be condenscend and simplified from these sites:

1. https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/  but I work mainly from the github website version at https://hpssjellis.github.io/beginner-tensorflowjs-examples-in-javascript/

2. The gitpod version of https://github.com/hpssjellis/Gitpod-auto-tensorflowJS-to-arduino   by using this link https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/Gitpod-auto-tensorflowJS-to-arduino

3. This Machine Learning site using the PortentaH7 which should work for many other Arduino boards (SeeeduinoXIAO, Nano 33BLESense PortentaH7 and hopefully the ESP32 eventually)  https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-for-the-arduino-portentaH7/tree/master/m09-Tensoflow
